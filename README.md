# DynamicShapeSaver-Interactive-3D-Shapes-with-Random-Textures-and-Persistence
# An OpenGL application that renders 9 textured cubes on the screen, each assigned a random texture. One shape is designated as the "active shape", which continuously rotates on its own axis. Users can switch the active shape, move it using keyboard controls, and change its geometry to various 3D forms such as cube, sphere, square, pyramid, cylinder, and frustum. Upon closing the program, all objects' positions, rotations, assigned textures, and final shape types are saved to a .txt file for persistence.
